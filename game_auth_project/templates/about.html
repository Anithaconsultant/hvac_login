            <h3>What is this?</h3>
            <p>
                Phantom Load is an interactive 3D computer game set in a realistic building environment. It will have 3
                levels of play:</p>
            <p>
                Level 1: Building Audit Challenge<br />
                Level 2: Troubleshooting Challenge<br />
                Level 3: Performance Optimization Challenge<br /></p>
            <p>
                Players explore the building, identify its components and energy use, investigate systems, improve the
                building performance, and lower carbon emissions.
            </p>
            <p>The current version is a live demo, a pre-alpha version of the game. </p>

            <h3>What is a phantom load?</h3>
            <p>Phantom loads are the electricity silently consumed when devices are plugged in but not actively used. It
                is the power used for standby functions, remote capabilities, and instant-on features even when
                appearing "off." Broadly, energy use that does not lead to productive use can be considered a phantom
                load. </p>
            <p>Join the hunt to discover phantom loads and use practical strategies to combat this energy waste.</p>

            <h3>Why this game?</h3>
            <p>The game transforms how we understand building science and energy flows by making the invisible visible.
                This hands-on approach creates a fundamentally different learning experience than typical educational
                settings, where building systems are taught as theoretical concepts. The game cultivates practical
                skills needed to spot inefficiencies and implement effective solutionsâ€”bridging the gap between
                classroom concepts and professional application. This can help players to make meaningful contributions
                to building performance improvement from day one in their careers.</p>
            <h3>Who is involved?</h3>
            <p>Phantom Load is developed by a team led by the Indian Institute for Human Settlements. </p>
