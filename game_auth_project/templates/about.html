        <div class=" text-content">
            <p>With the rapid rise in global energy consumption, decarbonizing and reducing energy waste in buildings is
                critical.
                This requires an in-depth understanding of interactions between building systems such as envelope,
                activities
                and plug
                loads, lighting, and air-conditioning design. It requires awareness of hidden or unnoticed energy
                drains,
                often
                referred
                to as latent or phantom loads. These silently consume power and are frequently overlooked. Addressing
                such
                inefficiencies can lead to significant energy savings.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are often taught as theoretical subjects in academic curricula, with little emphasis on real-world
                application. As
                a result, students often graduate without practical knowledge of how building systems interact and
                struggle
                to
                solve
                operational issues effectively.</p>
            <p>
                Phantom Load, an interactive 3D computer game set in a realistic building environment, allows learners
                to
                explore
                rooms, audit energy use, investigate HVAC systems, trace ductwork and piping, and make design or
                operational
                changes to
                improve thermal comfort and energy performance.</p>
            <p>
                The game will have three levels.<br />
                Level 1: Basic - Building Audit Mode<br />
                Level 2: Intermediate - Troubleshooting Mode<br />
                Level 3: Advanced â€“ Performance Optimization Mode<br /></p>
            <p>
                The pre-alpha version being exhibited today includes a sub-set of Level-1. Development of this learning
                game
                will
                continue in an accelerated manner from now on. Watch this space for further updates.</p>
